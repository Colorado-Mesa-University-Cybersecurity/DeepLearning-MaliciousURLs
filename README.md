# Machine Learning Models to Detect and Classify Malicious URLs

## Introduction

This research project compares the accuracies of varioius machine algorithms and deep learning frameworks in detecting and classifying malicious URLs using lexcial features.

Experiments results show that Random Forest, an ensemble-based classifier, not only outperformed 8 other traditional machine learning classifiers but also some deep neural network models generated by cutting-edge popular frameworks such as
TensorFlow and PyTorch in detecting and classifying malicious URLs using lexical features.

## Dataset

-   downloaded from: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/url-2016.html
-   run Baseline-Experiments.ipynb jupyter notebook to download dataset using provided Bash script

## Data Cleanup

-   dropped samples and attributes with NaN, Infifinity and mising values
-   removed whitespaces from column/attribute names

## Dataset Summary

-   labeled 5 URL types with total 36,707 samples (before cleanup)
-   consists of 79 lexical features extracted from URLs
-   table below shows original sample counts (Total) and New Totals (after data cleanup)
-   Total (Dropping NaN Rows) - remaining total samples after dropping samples with NaN values
    -   ~17K rows were dropped
-   Total (Dropping NaN Cols) - remaining total samples after dropping columns/attributes with NaN values
    -   7 attributes are dropped as a result with total 72 attributes remaining

## Deep Learning Frameworks

### fast.ai & PyTorch

-   fast.ai provides high level Python API wrapper over PyTorch with the goal of making deep learning easier to use
-   PyTorch is an open-source Python version of Torch machine learning framework developed by Facebook
-   PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs (a.k.a. Define-by-Run approach) which let you process variable-length inputs and outputs
-   network is defined dynamically via the actual forward computation

### Keras, TensorFlow & Theano

-   Keras is an open-source high-level neural networks API, written in Python and cabable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano
-   Keras allows for easy and fast prototyping
    -   through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility
    -   runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU
-   we experimented with TensorFlow and Theano as backend
-   TensorFlow is an open-source ML framework developed by Google
-   TensorFlow uses static computational graphs (a.k.a. Define-and-Run approach)
-   Theano is no longer maintained

## Model Evaluations

-   use 10-fold cross validation to estimate accuracy results
-   split dataset into 10 parts, train on 9 and test on 1 and repeat for all combination of train-test splits
-   calculate the average accuracy
